<h1>All About Headings!</h1>
<p>
	In an HTML document, headings act like titles. These titles come in various<br>sizes, much like the ones we find when we do word processing in Microsoft<br>Word/Google Docs.
</p>

<p>
	There are several different types of headings: 
</p>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Which is the largest</p>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h5>Heading 6</h5>
<p>Which is the smallest heading</p>
<p>It is important to remember, headings are for important titles. Don't use<br>headings to represent bold or larger font sized words. There are other tags<br>that we use to perform those functions. More on that in Challenge 2!
</p>
