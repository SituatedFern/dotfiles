TO BE, OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION:
WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE,
OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES,
AND BY OPPOSING END THEM: TO DIE, TO SLEEP
NO MORE; AND BY A SLEEP, TO SAY WE END
THE HEART-ACHE, AND THE THOUSAND NATURAL SHOCKS
THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO? 'TIS A CONSUMMATION
DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED. TO DIE, TO SLEEP,
TO SLEEP, PERCHANCE TO DREAM; AYE, THERE'S THE RUB,
FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME,
WHEN WE HAVE SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL,
MUST GIVE US PAUSE.
