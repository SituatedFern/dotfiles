# Form 17

## Cinematography
- Looks like they were filmed on steadycam
- When running everything is shakey to communicate speed

## Visual Design
- They are all wearing a bomb squad uniform

## Editing
- Quick cuts to make it seem more fast paced
- Slow zooms when something needs to be emphasized

## Sound Design
- Starts with an off putting sound and loud beating
- Cuts to cop car sounds
- There is "thinking music" playing the whole time
- Clock ticking + beeping
- Music cuts off abruptly to emphasize what was said
- Beeping speeds up with the music to communicate urgency
