# Nightmare at 20,000 feet

- In the teleplat she at least tries to comfort him
- In the TV show she just stares at him like a robot
- She barely talks to him
- He becomes more firm in the way that he says what is real
- She smiles at him in a really irritating way, as if she's talking to a child
- The gremlin also seems to be mocking him by disappearing whenever anyone sees him except Bob.
- Bob starts questioning himself and says "he did pull it up, he did!"
- Bob actually landed a shot on the gremlin in this movie
