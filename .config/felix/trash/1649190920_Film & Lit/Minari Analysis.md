# Minari Analysis

## Film theories:
- Critical Race Theory
- Psychoanalitical Theory

## Critical Race Theory x Psychoanalytical Theory
- It has a lot of family elements and shows the character grow up in Dallas
- The characters have to undergo a lot of changes and have a sort of cultural shock

## Critical Race Theory
- The family needs to adjust not only to living on a farm, but also living in the US.
- They struggle to find normalcy in the new place and start growing and selling Korean vegetables (hence the name Minari)
- The kids dislike their Korean background but end up with an appreciation for their culture.
- The white kids at the church give stranger looks to the family but the pastor seems to respect them.
